# Fraud Detection in Skilled Nursing Finance (ML)

## 🚨 Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to detect potential financial fraud in Skilled Nursing Facilities (SNFs) by building a machine learning classification model using synthetic claims and financial data inspired by CMS reports.

## 💡 Business Problem
Fraudulent billing and inflated costs are major risks in SNF finance. Identifying abnormal patterns in reported expenses and census counts can flag facilities for audit and reduce financial losses.

## 📦 Data Source
- **Synthetic claims and census data** based on CMS cost reports and financial best practices.

## ⚙️ Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, XGBoost)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualization

## 🎯 Features Used
- Average cost per patient
- Daily census volatility
- Administrative expense ratios
- Ownership type

## 📁 Files
- `fraud_detection_data.csv`: Synthetic labeled dataset
- `fraud_detection_model.ipynb`: ML notebook

## 📌 Outcome
- Classification report (precision, recall, F1)
- Feature importance plot
- Risk scores for sample facilities
